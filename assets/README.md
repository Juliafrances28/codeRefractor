# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it to either meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology.

Your task is to refactor an existing webpage.

An important rule to follow when working with someone else's code is the Scout Rule:

> Always leave the code you are editing a little cleaner than you found it.

## Assignment

Update the code in the Develop folder to ensure

- HTML is semantically correct
- A logical flow of html elements

- All links are workng
   <!-- In the <ul> <li> I test all the links to confirm that they work -->

- Title is logical
<!-- I wrote in a logical title here, meaning a title that makes sense based on the site main idea, in regards to what the site is expressing.  -->

- Images have alt tags
   <!-- I add an alt element to all six img tags -->

- CSS selectors and properties are efficient
  <!-- In the HTML, I changed the class for for the first three images to "search-engine".  I changed the class for the second three images to "benefits lead". This allows all three images have the same css properites while keeping the css dry and not repeative. -->

  <!-- In the HTML, I removed the id = within the opening  <div> tag. The id= are no longer nessecary because we combined the repeative code into one class. Classes are away to group elements together, applying the same css properties to all of them.  Id on the hand can only be applied to one element. Using Id in this case, would require us to apply the same properites for each element invidiually. Using best praticies it is important to keep the code dry and not repeative.  -->

  <!-- I foudn that many of css elements are repeative. Repeating the same properities for three different elements. I grouping three elements with the same css properities into one class. It is best to keep the code dry and not repeat things -->
